# Pewlett_Hackard - HR Analysis on Retiring Babyboomers


## Overview of the analysis:

Pewlett Hackard is a large company with a high percentage of employees approaching retirement age due to the Baby Boomer generational phenomenon. Since many of these employees are in managerial and leadership roles, the impact on the company could be catastrophic. We must be prepared for the massive employee turnover by realizing it's scale in advance. This information will be crucial in creating and implimenting systems, such as the proposed Mentorship Program, to buffer the impact. The purpose of this Human Resources analysis is to determine how many employees are becoming eligible for retirement in the near future, what positions do they hold, and which employees will be eligible for the Mentorship Progarm. 
 

### Method

#### Original Data:

PostgreSQL and pgADmin were used to conduct initial exploratory analases by querying the original data and creating tables.

    * Departments.csv
    * dept_emp.csv
    * dept_manager.csv
    * employees.csv
    * salaries_csv
    * titles_csv
    
For the purposes of this report, the following queries were performed to address our immediate questions.
    
    * retirement_titles.csv
    * unique_titles.csv
    * retiring_titles.csv
    * mentorship eligibilty.csv
  
     
## Determine how many employees are in a position to retire and their titles

* Create a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.

* Because some employees may have multiple titles in the database—for example, due to promotions— we need to create a table that contains the most recent title of each employee.

* Finally, create a final table that has the number of retirement-age employees grouped by most recent job title.

## Determine the employees eligible for the Mentorship Program

* Create a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.
